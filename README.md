We are simulating a hybrid electric vehicle. First we implement battery switching, that is, when the charge of one battery goes below 51.95%, this battery is switched off and the other battery starts to supply power to the load. Then we implement regenerative braking and the energy obtained from regenerative braking is used to charge the supercapacitor and the battery.This is implemented using a Triple Active Bridge converter, which is used to interface or combine multiple sources.
